 Data --> text,Image,audio,videos
 Data Preprocessinng is a process to covert raw data into meaning full data using different techniques

 Data in the real world is dirty --> incomplete , noisy ,Incosistent ,duplicate
 Data Quality Elements --> Accuracy ,Completeness ,consistency ,Believability ,Interpretability
 
 Steps:
 1.Data Cleaning
 2.Data Integration
 3.Data Reduction
 4.Data Transformation
 5.Data Discretization
 
 1.Data Cleaning:
    Means fill in missing vlaues, smooth out noise while identifying outliers and correct inconsistencies in the data.
    
 2.Data Integration:
    It is a technique to merge data from multiple sources into a coherent data store such as a data warehouse.
    
 3.Data Reduction:
    It is a technique used to reduce the data size by aggregating, eleminating redundant features , or clustering for instance.
 
 4.Data Transformation:
    Means Data are transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for ML model trainig such as normalization may be applied where data 
    are scaled to fall within a smaller range like 0.0 to 1.0.
    4.1.Aggration
    4.2.Feature type coonversion
    4.3.Normalization
    4.4.Attribute / feature construction
 
 5.Data Discretization:
    Technique transforms numeric data by mapping values to interval or concept labels.
    It can be used to reduce the number of values for a given continuesattribute by dividing the range of attribute into intervals.
    Techniques:
    1.Binning
    2.Histogram Analysis
    3.Clustering analysis
    4.Decision-tree analysis
    5.Correlation anlaysis
